 # PinkyPromise Examples
 
 This playground contains example uses of the `Result` and `Promise` types.

 ## Index

 1. [`Result`](Result) - A value or error. `Result` adapts the return-or-throw function pattern for asynchronous operations with callbacks.
 2. [`Promise`](Promise) - An operation that produces a `Result` sometime after it is started. `Promise`s can be composed and sequenced.
